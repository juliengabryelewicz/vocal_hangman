# Vocal Hangman

Hangman Game created with PyGame 2.1 and Python 3.8.

It uses Vosk for vocal command and Phonex for spell letter checking (only in French). Users can interact by saying a letter with a microphone and guessing the word.

You can add words thanks to words.txt available in assets/words.

Hangman's pictures came from Tech With Tim Hangman project.
